TASK 4
CALCULATOR

● For the task of designing a fundamental calculator using CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript, your objective involves constructing a user-engaging interface
featuring buttons tailored for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
functionalities.

● Within this calculator, a screen display must be integrated to exhibit both user
inputs and resultant outputs. The arrangement of buttons should leverage the CSS
grid system for a structured layout. Employ event listeners, conditional statements
(if-else), mathematical operators, and loops to effectively manage user inputs and
execute computations.

● Although this project demands a certain level of proficiency, it remains achievable
with a fundamental grasp of these technologies.
